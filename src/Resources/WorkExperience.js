        blurb:"I am proud of my experience with Iris Reading because I had to manage myself and think critically as a consultant.\
        The designs had been made for the initial work that needed to be done, and a lot of the logic had been figured out,\
        so I had to build the designs with the logic. Then, as time went on, we decided on some more ideas for novel content,\
        like a user database so that users could track how their reading speed improves over time. This experience has taught me very valuable lessons\
        about time management and how to scope for uncertainty.",

        (this was my first software job). My journey took me to the recesses of VBA, and learning how to create windows services, a neat skill in itself. Things\
        really kicked up to 11 though when I was asked to look into migrating old code from 1989 to be run on a modern Xamarin-based interface. It was frustrating,\
