                            I'm an almost-graduated student at UWaterloo in Computer Science with an interest in security. 
                            I've spent a great deal of time bouncing between projects in hopes of finding the next thing that sucks me in for an unbounded number of hours.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I try to never let a challenge get me down, and to treat everything I do as a learning opportunity.
                            These sound like canned words, but I regularly do things I never thought I'd be doing 5 years ago: I own a server, I do 3D printing and 3D modelling, as well as streaming video games and drawing.
                            I value hands-on experience but I just generally love getting my hands dirty, virtually included.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <p>
                            I am currently looking for full time positions starting as soon as September 2023, so please read on if you've got something
                            that you think I might be right for!

                            I loved attending UWaterloo! I owe a lot of my respect for security 
                            as a field to the CrySP group and the profs within it. 
                            I definitely would recommend it to anyone looking to get engrossed in Computer Science

                            My favourite course had to have been CS246E, as I learned more about OOP from that 
                            course than perhaps at any other point in my life, and have been able to apply 
                            the themes from that course in just about every project I have done since then.

                            I pretty regularly find myself doing something and think: this is really cool, but I almost never show off any of the stuff that I do.
